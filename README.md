✈️ AI Aircraft Maintenance Prediction System
 Project Description
The AI Aircraft Maintenance Prediction System is a Streamlit-based web application designed to monitor aircraft health and predict maintenance requirements. The system helps identify expired components, analyze flight data, and provide maintenance alerts to improve safety and reduce downtime.

 Features
- Select aircraft manufacturer (Airbus / Boeing)
- View registered aircraft details
- Predict maintenance needs using flight data
- Detect expired components with alerts
- View aircraft maintenance history
- Interactive and user-friendly dashboard
- Back/return navigation between pages

 Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Machine Learning (basic prediction logic)
- Matplotlib / Plotly (optional for visualization)

 Use Case - This system can assist airlines and maintenance teams in:
- Proactive maintenance planning  
- Reducing unexpected aircraft failures  
- Improving operational efficiency  
- Enhancing aviation safety
